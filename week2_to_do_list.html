<p>Pay attention to how the authors transition from section to section as well as how they use the literature as evidence to support what they are saying or what they have found. Observe how the authors have identified the need for their study (rationale) as well as the study&rsquo;s purpose. Also, note the content found in the abstract, introduction, literature review, results, and discussion sections.</p>
<h3>Activity 2: APA Quiz</h3>
<p>Complete the APA quiz this week, which reviews APA material covered in week 1. A link to the quiz is here and the quiz is also available under Course Resources.

<h3>Activity 6: Discussion - Online Article Review: Evaluating Research Articles</h3>
<p>Your facilitator will assign you to teams this week, and you will analyze <strong>one</strong> article addressing the following questions</p>
<p>1. What is the purpose of this article? What is your evidence for suggesting this is the purpose? If it is not overtly stated, then what do you think the author&rsquo;s purpose was?</p>
<p>2. List <strong>and discuss</strong> 2 -3 articles representing some of prior research on which this study is based (hint: see the lit review)</p>
<p>3. What are some of the key points or findings this article presents?</p>
<p>4. What is the significance of the study? (significance is what the article contributes as a whole to the body of knowledge about this topic)</p>
<p>5. Do the authors present recommendations for future research and studies that build on the topics discussed in this article?</p>
<p>6. What do the authors do well in this article?</p>
<p>7. What problems do you see with the article (problem definition, data collection, literature, conclusions)? Why do you think these<img src="/d2l/img/lp/pixel.gif" alt="" /> are problems?&nbsp;</p>
